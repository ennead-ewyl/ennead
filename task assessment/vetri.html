               <ul> On <b>31 December 2019</b>, WHO was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan City, China. A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause by Chinese authorities on 7 January 2020 and was temporarily named “2019-nCoV”.<br></ul>
               <ul> Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. <b>A novel coronavirus (nCoV)</b> is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The new virus was subsequently named the <b>“COVID-19 virus”</b><br></ul>
               <ul> <b>On 30 January 2020</b>, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a <b>public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)</b>, WHO's highest level of alarm. At that time there were 98 cases and no deaths in 18 countries outside China.<br></ul>
               <ul><b> On 11 March 2020</b>, the rapid increase in the number of cases outside China led the WHO Director-General to announce that the outbreak could be characterized as a pandemic. By then more than <b>118 000 cases had been reported in 114 countries, and 4291 deaths had been recorded.</b></ul>
