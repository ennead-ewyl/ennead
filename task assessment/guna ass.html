                Women empowerment refers to making women powerful to make them capable of deciding for 
                themselves.Women have suffered a lot through the years at the hands of men. In earlier 
                centuries,they were treated as almost non-existent. As if all the rights belonged to men 
                even something as basic as voting. As the times evolved, women realized their power.
                There on began the revolution for women empowerment.As women were not allowed to make 
                decisions for them, women empowerment came in like a breath of fresh air. It made them 
                aware of their rights and how they must make their own place in society rather than depending
                 on a man. It recognized the fact that things cannot simply work in someoneâ€™s favor because of
                  their gender. However, we still have a long way to go when we talk about the reasons why
                 we need it.
